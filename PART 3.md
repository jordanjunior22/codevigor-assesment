# Time Management Task

## Problems

1. Fix a critical bug in the login module.
2. Develop a new feature that has been highly requested by clients.
3. Document the API you developed in Task 1.
4. Optimize the database queries in an existing module.

## Weekly Plan

### DAY 1
I will fix the critical bug in the login module first because it's the most important part of the application, and without it, the application will not be usable.

### DAY 2
After I have found the solution for the bug, I will document the API to keep track of the errors, which will also be useful for future development.

### DAY 3
I will optimize the database queries in the existing module so that the application can run smoothly, instead of writing additional code, which can lead to confusion due to complexity.

### DAY 4 - 7
- Day 4: I will kick off with the development of the new feature and make an analysis of the requirements and design.
- Day 5: After finalizing the requirements, I will start coding.
- Day 6: Mostly focused on testing.
- Day 7: Finalize documentation.
