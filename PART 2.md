# Question 2.1

## Code Structure

### Clear Documentation

I included comments throughout the code to explain the purpose and functionality of different functions and classes. This ensures that other developers can understand and work with the code effectively.

### Error Handling

I implemented proper error handling to gracefully deal with unexpected situations. This prevents the application from crashing and provides meaningful error messages for debugging.

### Testing

I used dummy variables for testing purposes.

## Production Environment Considerations

### Framework

In a production environment, I will consider using a module like MVC. This makes it easier to understand and modify individual components.

### Security

In a production environment, I will consider using an env file to keep my keys and authentication variables safe.

# Question 2.2

**Problem 1:** 
```javascript
let user = req.body;
```
explanation: We did the check if the user is present.. 
solution: we should use if statement to check  if the user is true and make sure its of valid type.

**Problem 2:** 
```javascript
else {
db.addUser(user);
res.status(200).send("User added");
}
```
explanation: There is no error handling for the database operations. 
solution:Implement error handling to catch and properly handle database errors. 

**Problem 3:** 
No use of json responses
explanation : The code sends simple text responses for success and error, which may not be easy to handle on the client-side.
solution: Use a consistent JSON response format, including status codes, data, and error messages. This format makes it easier for client applications to handle responses.
